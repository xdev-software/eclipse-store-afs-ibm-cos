# eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos

A connector for the [EclipseStore](https://eclipsestore.io/) which allows storing data in the [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).

It uses the [IBM-provided Java SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-java).

The connector works virtually identical to the [AWS S3 Connector](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/blob-stores/aws-s3.html) of EclipseStore but for IBM COS instead of AWS S3.

To easily handle multiple processes using a single IBM COS instance, we implemented
the [SingleAccessManager](eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos/src/main/java/software/xdev/eclipse/store/afs/ibm/access/SingleAccessManager.java).
It manages access by creating tokens and checking for other tokens. For more information
see [the demo application](eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/ApplicationWithSingleAccess.java).

## Installation

[Installation guide for the latest release](https://github.com/xdev-software/eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos/releases/latest#Installation)

## Supported EclipseStore versions

The connector
supports [version 1.2.0 of the EclipseStore](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.eclipse.store/storage-embedded/01.02.00).

If you are using a different, not listed version of EclipseStore, this shouldn't be a problem.
Usually you can simply exclude the dependent version of EclipseStore.
