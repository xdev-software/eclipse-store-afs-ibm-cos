# eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos

A connector for the [EclipseStore](https://eclipsestore.io/) which allows storing data in the [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).

It uses the [IBM-provided Java SDK](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-java).

The connector works virtually identical to the [AWS S3 Connector](https://docs.eclipsestore.io/manual/storage/storage-targets/blob-stores/aws-s3.html) of EclipseStore but for IBM COS instead of AWS S3.

To easily handle multiple processes using a single IBM COS instance, we implemented the [SingleAccessManager](eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos/src/main/java/software/xdev/eclipse/store/afs/ibm/access/SingleAccessManager.java).
It manages access by creating tokens and checking for other tokens. For more information see [the demo application](eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos-demo/src/main/java/software/xdev/ApplicationWithSingleAccess.java).

## Installation

[Installation guide for the latest release](https://github.com/xdev-software/eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos/releases/latest#Installation)

## Supported EclipseStore versions

To find out the currently supported EclipseStore version of the connector have a look at its ``compile`` dependencies and search for ``org.eclipse.store``.<br/>
This can be done inside an IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA), via a Maven Web explorer (e.g. [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.xdev/eclipse-store-afs-ibm-cos)) or - for the latest version - have a look into the [``Dependencies``](./README.md#dependencies-and-licenses) section below.<br/>
As an alternative you can also check the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

If you are using a different, not listed version of EclipseStore this shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
Usually you can simply exclude the dependent version of EclipseStore.
